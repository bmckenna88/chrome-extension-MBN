# CTRL-F Extension
#To get what we have up and running:
####1.) from the root of our git project `cd to POC/django_backend/chrome`
####2.) `python manage.py runserver`
this launches django on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
####4.) in chrome address bar type `chrome://extensions/`
####5.) Click load unpacked extension and select POC/chrome_restart/ (poorly named for now) from our project.  
Note: developer mode checkbox in top right must be checked.
####This should allow for you to hit the button in chrome and see action in your terminal where django is running. Much work to be done.
