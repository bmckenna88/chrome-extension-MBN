it 67.09 67.22
now 68.81 69.11
what's 71.6 71.82
remarkable 71.82 72.41
is 72.41 72.54
that 72.54 72.71

in 78.84 78.92
those 78.92 79.11

become 79.86 80.15
reactive 80.15 80.67

them 84.59 84.83
and 85.68 85.89
then 85.89 86.12
as 86.12 86.43
you 86.43 86.54
move 86.54 86.87
through 86.87 87.42
the 87.42 87.57
layers 87.57 88.22
the 89.72 89.78

so 93.16 93.35
maybe 93.35 93.68
they 93.68 93.89
would 93.89 94.05
react 94.05 94.57
