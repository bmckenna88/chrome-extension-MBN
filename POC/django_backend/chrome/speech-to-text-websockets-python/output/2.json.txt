a 49.79 49.84
very 49.84 50.04
simple 50.04 50.31

like 50.87 51.06
an 51.06 51.13

or 51.69 51.88
an 51.88 52.04
application 52.04 52.48
of 52.48 52.54
a 52.54 52.59
simple 52.59 52.89

it 54.21 54.31
takes 54.31 54.63

from 55.08 55.47
many 55.5 55.85
other 55.85 56.06
near 56.06 56.28
us 56.28 56.69
sort 57.07 57.26
of 57.26 57.44
a 57.74 57.85
bummer 57.85 58.14
it's 58.14 58.35
that 58.35 58.83
data 58.98 59.38
that 59.38 59.53
comes 59.53 59.78
in 59.78 60.0
and 60.0 60.16
sends 60.16 60.46
it 60.46 60.57
downstream 60.57 61.31
to 61.31 61.47
of 61.5 61.6
the 61.6 61.67
neurones 61.67 62.15

these 62.55 62.68
things 62.68 62.9
are 62.9 62.96
connected 62.96 63.43
in 63.43 63.53
a 63.53 63.57
kind 63.57 63.77
of 63.77 63.86
network 63.86 64.44
this 67.41 67.51
example 67.51 67.86
here 67.86 68.35
is 69.08 69.87
a 69.9 69.96
classic 69.96 70.41
computer 70.41 70.68
vision 70.68 70.93
problem 70.93 71.38
where 71.38 71.59
you 71.59 71.7
have 71.7 71.92
pictures 71.92 72.36
and 72.36 72.48
you 72.48 72.58
want 72.58 72.76
to 72.76 72.82
basically 72.82 73.25
classified 73.25 73.85
you 74.57 74.75
want 74.75 74.87
to 74.87 75.01
have 75.21 75.46
a 75.46 75.51
computer 75.51 75.85
program 75.85 76.22
that 76.22 76.33
can 76.33 76.44
tell 76.44 76.71
the 76.71 76.92

whatever 78.73 79.01
so 79.98 80.13
when 80.13 80.24
you 80.24 80.32
try 80.32 80.55
and 80.55 80.68
solve 80.68 80.94
