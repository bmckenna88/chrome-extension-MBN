once 0.06 0.25
you 0.25 0.32
have 0.32 0.44
a 0.44 0.48
network 0.48 0.85
that's 0.85 1.05
trained 1.05 1.32
this 1.32 1.49
way 1.49 1.76
it 2.45 2.55
should 2.55 2.76
be 2.76 2.86
possible 2.86 3.41
to 3.41 3.56
also 3.56 3.92
run 3.92 4.12
this 4.12 4.28
thing 4.28 4.44
backwards 4.44 4.96
if 5.97 6.16
you 6.16 6.47
have 6.66 6.86
a 6.86 6.9
thing 6.9 7.18
that 7.18 7.33
knows 7.33 7.62
everything 7.62 7.97
about 7.97 8.25
what 8.3 8.62
a 8.74 8.82
cat 8.82 9.12
has 9.12 9.28
like 9.28 9.7
it 9.89 10.01
should 10.01 10.14
be 10.14 10.23
able 10.23 10.39
to 10.39 10.46
produce 10.46 10.74
new 10.74 10.87
pictures 10.87 11.32
that 11.32 11.48
look 11.48 11.64
like 11.64 11.79
cats 11.79 12.22
or 12.43 12.56
dogs 12.56 13.03
and 13.82 13.93
so 13.93 14.34
it 15.03 15.09
is 15.09 15.19
a 15.19 15.25
cool 15.25 15.51
sort 15.51 15.7
of 15.7 15.86
generative 15.86 16.32
neural 16.32 16.56
networks 16.56 17.13
and 17.62 18.15
I'm 18.2 18.29
gonna 18.29 18.42
show 18.42 18.56
you 18.56 18.65
a 18.65 18.7
couple 18.7 18.95
of 18.95 19.04
examples 19.04 19.92
of 20.29 20.72
it's 21.42 21.48
kind 21.48 21.73
of 21.73 21.84
your 21.84 22.02
network 22.02 22.47
one 23.95 24.16
of 24.16 24.26
them 24.26 24.41
started 24.41 24.82
with 24.82 25.08
experiments 25.08 25.73
by 25.73 25.99
Alexander 25.99 26.56
more 26.56 26.75
consists 26.75 27.3
of 27.45 27.56
Google 27.56 27.94
he 28.28 28.89
was 29.11 29.3
interested 29.3 29.88
to 29.88 30.01
create 30.01 30.48
visualizations 30.48 31.47
of 31.5 32.07
the 32.43 32.58
internal 32.58 33.0
knowledge 33.0 33.46
sort 33.46 33.78
of 33.78 33.84
stored 33.84 34.19
in 34.19 34.28
the 34.28 34.35
near 34.35 34.53
network 34.53 35.03
and 35.29 35.4
you 35.4 35.46
can 35.46 35.56
have 35.56 35.75
this 35.75 35.89
really 35.89 36.11
neat 36.11 36.32
algorithm 36.35 36.95
will 37.62 37.75
you 37.75 37.9
show 37.9 38.31
a 38.75 39.22
and 40.13 40.26
it 40.26 40.38
worked 40.38 40.73
that's 40.8 40.99
trained 40.99 41.25
on 41.25 41.34
whatever 41.34 41.68
extra 42.66 42.92
you 43.65 43.77
run 43.77 43.97
the 43.97 44.04
network 44.04 44.38
for 44.38 44.85
and 45.98 46.16
then 46.16 46.52
you 47.37 47.52
basically 47.52 47.85
say 47.85 48.05
okay 48.05 48.21
whatever 48.21 48.53
you 48.53 48.64
saw 48.64 49.2
we're 50.02 50.16
gonna 50.16 50.39
just 50.39 50.66
the 50.66 50.73
pixels 50.73 51.27
in 51.27 51.43
the 51.43 51.53
image 51.53 52.03
towards 52.27 52.74
that 52.74 52.95
interpretation 52.95 53.66
just 54.53 54.69
a 54.69 54.73
little 54.73 54.91
bit 54.91 55.06
if 55.6 55.73
you 55.73 55.8
do 55.8 55.91
this 55.91 56.1
over 56.1 56.32
and 56.32 56.41
over 56.41 56.65
again 56.65 57.12
you 57.69 57.78
get 57.78 58.07
these 58.24 58.61
kinds 58.61 58.86
of 58.86 58.94
images 58.94 59.49
suddenly 60.22 60.66
the 60.66 60.84
photograph 61.06 61.94
fills 61.98 62.58
with 62.58 62.76
all 62.76 62.98
these 62.98 63.15
interesting 63.15 63.77
impressions 63.77 64.44
of 64.44 64.59
the 64.59 64.66
new 64.66 64.87
network 64.87 65.27
knew 65.27 65.43
about 65.43 65.79
it 66.68 66.79
seems 66.79 66.98
like 66.98 67.12
cloud 67.12 67.42
watching 67.42 67.88
the 68.26 68.32
slightest 68.32 68.78
adjust 68.78 69.07
the 69.07 69.15
features 69.15 69.9
suddenly 70.09 70.47
turn 70.47 70.82
into 70.82 71.03
dog 71.03 71.25
faces 71.25 71.88
and 71.88 72.02
cars 72.02 72.64
and 72.64 72.79
buildings 72.79 73.25
so 74.65 74.75
when 74.75 74.84
I 74.84 74.88
saw 74.88 75.06
this 75.06 75.22
I 75.22 75.31
got 75.31 75.45
really 75.45 75.62
interested 75.62 76.17
as 76.48 76.65
an 76.65 76.72
artist 76.72 77.2
I 77.2 77.29
thought 77.29 77.52
this 77.52 77.68
would 77.68 77.77
be 77.77 77.85
really 77.85 78.05
interesting 78.05 78.42
to 78.42 78.56
use 78.56 78.73
to 78.73 78.85
make 78.85 79.22
art 79.4 79.71
the 80.1 80.22
first 80.22 80.43
thing 80.43 80.58
I 80.58 80.63
tried 80.63 81.1
was 81.1 81.44
what 82.44 82.71
if 82.71 82.79
we 82.79 82.85
just 82.85 83.0
stop 83.0 83.2
random 83.2 83.63
noise 83.63 84.1
and 84.7 84.87
also 84.87 85.11
what 85.11 85.28
happens 85.28 85.6
if 85.6 85.7
we 85.7 85.78
serve 85.78 86.01
keep 86.01 86.26
zooming 86.26 86.73
into 86.76 87.02
the 87.02 87.11
picture 87.11 87.53
and 88.34 88.78
this 88.87 88.99
is 88.99 89.1
what 89.1 89.22
I 89.22 89.27
found 89.27 89.7
so 96.94 97.1
you 97.1 97.22
get 97.22 97.39
this 97.39 97.61
really 97.61 97.9
interesting 97.9 98.66
sort 98.92 99.12
of 99.12 99.18
fractal 99.18 99.8
world 99.8 100.19
appear 100.19 100.6
where 101.01 101.37
the 101.67 101.79
network 101.79 102.11
keeps 102.11 102.52
over 102.52 102.83
interpreting 102.83 103.41
it 103.41 103.52
over 103.52 103.8
interpreting 103.8 104.43
the 104.43 104.54
image 104.54 104.86
get 107.66 107.77
some 107.77 107.89
going 107.89 108.07
for 108.07 108.21
ever 108.21 108.45
since 108.45 108.73
you 109.04 109.15
can 109.15 109.26
just 109.26 109.41
keep 109.41 109.52
going 109.52 109.79
what's 115.09 115.29
interesting 115.29 115.65
to 115.65 116.16
is 117.1 117.23
the 117.23 117.32
depending 117.32 117.59
on 117.59 117.71
where 117.71 118.02
you 118.02 118.14
do 118.14 118.28
this 118.28 118.48
in 118.48 118.56
the 118.56 118.64
network 118.64 119.16
it 119.41 119.59
review 119.59 119.98
